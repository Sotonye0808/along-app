**Last updated: June 2026**

## Acceptance of Terms

By creating an account or using Along, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the platform.

## User Responsibilities

- You must be at least 13 years old to use Along
- You are responsible for the accuracy of routes and information you share
- You may not use Along for any illegal or unauthorised purpose
- You must not attempt to manipulate trust scores or validity ratings

## Content Guidelines

When sharing routes on Along:

- Route information should be accurate and based on your personal experience
- Do not share false or misleading route information
- Respect the privacy of others - do not share personal information about other commuters
- Do not post spam, advertisements, or promotional content

## Trust Scores

Trust scores are calculated algorithmically based on community interactions, route detail, corroboration, and recency. Along reserves the right to adjust scores to maintain platform integrity.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, including accounts engaged in spam, fraud, or abuse of the trust system.

## Limitation of Liability

Along provides route information as a community service. Route accuracy is not guaranteed. Always verify critical route information through official sources. Along is not liable for losses arising from reliance on user-shared route information.

## Changes

We may update these terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
